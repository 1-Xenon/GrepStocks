The TP Advanced Manufacturing Centre (AMC) faces significant challenges in its existing inventory management and sales tracking processes. The prevailing system exhibits inefficiencies, manifesting in problems such as inaccurate stock levels, delayed sales reporting, and cumbersome product detail management. This operational inefficiency adversely affects the overall productivity and effectiveness of AMC's operations, impeding its capacity to promptly respond to customer demands and optimize resource utilization.

To help alleviate this operational inefficiency, GrepStocks, a web application that focuses on inventory management and sales tracking is created to serve its target audience - staff working within the AMC and the general public who are looking to purchase items that are being produced within the AMC
